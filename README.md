### **What is Jekyll?**

**Jekyll** is a static site generator written in Ruby. It takes plain text files (written in Markdown, HTML, or Liquid templates) and converts them into a fully functional static website. Jekyll is widely used for creating blogs, documentation sites, and personal websites. It’s the engine behind **GitHub Pages**, making it a popular choice for hosting websites directly from a GitHub repository.

### **Key Features of Jekyll**
1. **Static Site Generation**: Jekyll generates static HTML files, which are fast, secure, and easy to host.
2. **Markdown Support**: Write content in Markdown, and Jekyll will convert it to HTML.
3. **Liquid Templating**: Use Liquid (a templating language) to create dynamic layouts and reusable components.
4. **Blogging Support**: Built-in support for blogs with posts, categories, tags, and archives.
5. **Themes**: Use pre-built themes or create your own to style your site.
6. **GitHub Pages Integration**: Host your Jekyll site for free on GitHub Pages.

### **Getting Started with Jekyll**

#### **Step 1: Install Prerequisites**
Jekyll requires **Ruby**, **RubyGems**, and **GCC** (for compiling native extensions). Follow these steps to install them:

1. **Install Ruby**:
   - On Ubuntu:
     ```bash
     sudo apt-get update
     sudo apt-get install ruby-full build-essential zlib1g-dev
     ```
   - On macOS (Ruby is pre-installed, but you may need to update it using `brew`):
     ```bash
     brew install ruby
     ```

2. **Set Up RubyGems**:
   Add the following to your `~/.bashrc` or `~/.zshrc` file to ensure RubyGems installs packages in your user directory:
   ```bash
   export GEM_HOME="$HOME/.gem"
   export PATH="$HOME/.gem/bin:$PATH"
   ```
   Then, reload your shell:
   ```bash
   source ~/.bashrc
   ```

3. **Install GCC** (if not already installed):
   - On Ubuntu:
     ```bash
     sudo apt-get install gcc
     ```
   - On macOS:
     ```bash
     xcode-select --install
     ```

---

#### **Step 2: Install Jekyll and Bundler**
Use RubyGems to install Jekyll and Bundler (a dependency manager for Ruby):
```bash
gem install jekyll bundler
```

Verify the installation:
```bash
jekyll -v
```

---

#### **Step 3: Create a New Jekyll Site**
1. Generate a new Jekyll site:
   ```bash
   jekyll new my-site
   ```
   Replace `my-site` with your desired project name.

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd my-site
   ```

3. Build the site and start a local server:
   ```bash
   bundle exec jekyll serve
   ```

4. Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:4000` to view your site.

---

#### **Step 4: Customize Your Site**
1. **Edit Configuration**:
   - Open `_config.yml` in your project directory to customize site settings (e.g., title, description, URL).

2. **Add Content**:
   - Create new Markdown files in the `_posts` directory for blog posts. Use the following naming convention:
     ```
     YYYY-MM-DD-title.md
     ```
   - Example post content:
     ```markdown
     ---
     layout: post
     title: "My First Post"
     date: 2023-10-01
     ---
     This is my first Jekyll post!
     ```

3. **Customize Layouts**:
   - Edit files in the `_layouts` directory to modify the structure of your pages.

4. **Add Themes**:
   - Install a theme by adding it to your `Gemfile`:
     ```ruby
     gem "minima"
     ```
   - Then, update your `_config.yml`:
     ```yaml
     theme: minima
     ```

---

#### **Step 5: Build and Deploy Your Site**
1. **Build the Site**:
   Run the following command to generate the static files:
   ```bash
   bundle exec jekyll build
   ```
   The generated files will be in the `_site` directory.

2. **Deploy to GitHub Pages**:
   - Push your Jekyll site to a GitHub repository.
   - Go to the repository settings and enable GitHub Pages under the "Pages" section.
   - Your site will be available at `https://<username>.github.io/<repository-name>`.
